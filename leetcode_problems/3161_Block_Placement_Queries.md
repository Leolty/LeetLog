## Problem Statement

There exists an infinite number line, with its origin at 0 and extending towards the **positive** x\-axis.

You are given a 2D array `queries`, which contains two types of queries:

1. For a query of type 1, `queries[i] = [1, x]`. Build an obstacle at distance `x` from the origin. It is guaranteed that there is **no** obstacle at distance `x` when the query is asked.
2. For a query of type 2, `queries[i] = [2, x, sz]`. Check if it is possible to place a block of size `sz` *anywhere* in the range `[0, x]` on the line, such that the block **entirely** lies in the range `[0, x]`. A block **cannot** be placed if it intersects with any obstacle, but it may touch it. Note that you do **not** actually place the block. Queries are separate.

Return a boolean array `results`, where `results[i]` is `true` if you can place the block specified in the `ith` query of type 2, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** queries \= \[\[1,2],\[2,3,3],\[2,3,1],\[2,2,2]]

**Output:** \[false,true,true]

**Explanation:**

For query 0, place an obstacle at `x = 2`. A block of size at most 2 can be placed before `x = 3`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** queries \= \[\[1,7],\[2,7,6],\[1,2],\[2,7,5],\[2,7,6]]

**Output:** \[true,true,false]

**Explanation:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/04/22/example1block.png)**

* Place an obstacle at `x = 7` for query 0\. A block of size at most 7 can be placed before `x = 7`.
* Place an obstacle at `x = 2` for query 2\. Now, a block of size at most 5 can be placed before `x = 7`, and a block of size at most 2 before `x = 2`.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= queries.length <= 15 * 104`
* `2 <= queries[i].length <= 3`
* `1 <= queries[i][0] <= 2`
* `1 <= x, sz <= min(5 * 104, 3 * queries.length)`
* The input is generated such that for queries of type 1, no obstacle exists at distance `x` when the query is asked.
* The input is generated such that there is at least one query of type 2\.

## Hints

- 1\. Let `d[x]` be the distance of the next obstacle after `x`.
- 2\. For each query of type 2, we just need to check if `max(d[0], d[1], d[2], â€¦d[x - sz]) > sz`.
- 3\. Use segment tree to maintain `d[x]`.
