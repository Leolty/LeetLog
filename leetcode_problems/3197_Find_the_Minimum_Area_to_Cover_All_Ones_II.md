## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D **binary** array `grid`. You need to find 3 **non\-overlapping** rectangles having **non\-zero** areas with horizontal and vertical sides such that all the 1's in `grid` lie inside these rectangles.

Return the **minimum** possible sum of the area of these rectangles.

**Note** that the rectangles are allowed to touch.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid \= \[\[1,0,1],\[1,1,1]]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/05/14/example0rect21.png)

* The 1's at `(0, 0)` and `(1, 0)` are covered by a rectangle of area 2\.
* The 1's at `(0, 2)` and `(1, 2)` are covered by a rectangle of area 2\.
* The 1 at `(1, 1)` is covered by a rectangle of area 1\.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid \= \[\[1,0,1,0],\[0,1,0,1]]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/05/14/example1rect2.png)

* The 1's at `(0, 0)` and `(0, 2)` are covered by a rectangle of area 3\.
* The 1 at `(1, 1)` is covered by a rectangle of area 1\.
* The 1 at `(1, 3)` is covered by a rectangle of area 1\.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 30`
* `grid[i][j]` is either 0 or 1\.
* The input is generated such that there are at least three 1's in `grid`.

## Hints

- 1\. Consider covering using 2 rectangles. As the rectangles donâ€™t overlap, one of the rectangles must either be vertically above or horizontally left to the other.
- 2\. To find the minimum area, check all possible vertical and horizontal splits.
- 3\. For 3 rectangles, extend the idea to first covering using one rectangle, and then try splitting leftover ones both horizontally and vertically.
